ATOR 

is an app designed to connect people around the world through working out. Users enter in workouts they have done every day or every week, their choice. They can create clubs, invite friends, and compete to see who has been working out the most. There are club leaderboards for each friend group and a global leaderboard.

A new user, when first accessing the app, is invited to see a selection of leaderboards including the global leaderboard to get a feel for what the site is about and what to expect when using the site. The user must create an account before entering in workouts. The user will be given the option to find friends groups, request admission to a friend group (authorized by the group leader, the user who created the group), create a friends group or invite another user to an existing friend group. The user will also have access to a help page, tips and tricks, and viewing the global leaderboard. Users creating a friends group have the option of making it public or private. Friends groups can compete in matches against each other to prove the superiority of their members.
